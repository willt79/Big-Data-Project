I don't  -care- that she ""has a job"" too or ""can work too"" none of those issues matter to me as it's the CHILD who has the right and if she works and takes care of her off spring because he knocked her up then he should be forced to help her by surrundering part of his check as well.


I'm not enraged. I'm apathetic. If you knock a woman up she has the right to decide if she wants the kid and if she decides she's going to have them and you don't want them I don't care -you're paying child support. Maybe you shouldn't be messing around if you didn't want to be trapped in that situation.

So because I didn't mention some net benefit that only you are aware of, the net benefits I did mention are false?  That's an interesting viewpoint.

While some people like to say that this will generate increased tax revenue, that is false - there is no increased tax revenue, since the individuals in question will virtually all be in the bottom two income quintiles, who not only have a negative effective income tax rate so they won't be paying income tax - it is large enough that it completely offsets any payroll tax they pay.

So, not only are they not paying income and payroll taxes, they will become an additional drain on the social welfare system as they begin collecting Food Stamps, etc.

In addition, they will eventually be eligible to collect Social Security and Medicare - systems that are already paying out more than they receive in tax revenue, on the payroll taxes of citizens who earn 2-3 times what the Amnestied illegals ever will (even if those payroll taxes hadn't been completely refunded to the illegals).

FBI reports from 1996 consistently put the number of ""unfounded"" rape accusations around 8%. In contrast, the average rate of unfounded reports for ""Index crimes"" tracked by the FBI is 2%.[15]

However, ""unfounded"" is not synonymous with false allegation. Bruce Gross of the Forensic Examiner says that:

This statistic is almost meaningless, as many of the jurisdictions from which the FBI collects data on crime use different definitions of, or criteria for, ""unfounded."" That is, a report of rape might be classified as unfounded (rather than as forcible rape) if the alleged victim did not try to fight off the suspect, if the alleged perpetrator did not use physical force or a weapon of some sort, if the alleged victim did not sustain any physical injuries, or if the alleged victim and the accused had a prior sexual relationship. Similarly, a report might be deemed unfounded if there is no physical evidence or too many inconsistencies between the accuser's statement and what evidence does exist.

That is not mutually exclusive with "" ""Actually it's one of the most highly falsely accused crime.""

if nearly all of them are below 10 percent.

God, you're an idiot and what's worse is you think you're smart.

""false rape accusations are exceedingly rare. "" """"Actually it's one of the most highly falsely accused crime.""

And? What's your point? False Rape accusations are Still EXCEEDINGLY rare at about 8%

your attempting to obsusficate and mislead this debate with a rather petty point

""Actually it's one of the most highly falsely accused crime.""

your Point is misleading because if that's true it  seems people rarely falsely accuse people of much of anything.

&gt;

&gt;In [argumentation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory), an ___argumentum ad populum___ ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) for ""__appeal to the people__"") is a [fallacious argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) that concludes a [proposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition) is true because many or most people believe it. In other words, the basic idea of the argument is: ""If many believe so, it is so.""

&gt;This type of argument is known by several names,  including __appeal to the masses__, __appeal to belief__, __appeal to the majority__, __appeal to democracy__, __appeal to popularity__, __argument by consensus__, __consensus fallacy__, __authority of the many__, and __bandwagon fallacy__, and in [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) as ___argumentum ad numerum___ (""appeal to the number""), and ___consensus gentium___ (""agreement of the clans""). It is also the basis of a number of social phenomena, including [communal reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_reinforcement) and the [bandwagon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect). The Chinese [proverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb) ""[three men make a tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_men_make_a_tiger)"" concerns the same idea.

That seems like hypocrisy to me. 

However, I'm sure just like I look at this article and think 'well, that characterization doesn't represent my views properly', I'm sure many Republicans would argue the same against me. For instance, the article makes several statements definitively that I don't subscribe to, then states a definitive motivation which, even when I agree with the original statement, doesn't describe my thought about why I believe that way. 

&gt; For instance, this from the article: ""When Republicans invoke God or religious faith as an inspiration for their political views, it’s threatening and creepy. When Democrats do it, it’s a sign they believe in social justice."" 

I would say it's religious views are only perceived as 'threatening and creepy' (accepting the terms for the sake of argument) when the views are used as the basis for laws seen by liberals as discriminatory or judgmental. Using these views in your private life? Knock yourself out. I'm a religious person myself, I just hold as sacred the right of others to live their own lives (smaller government?) without imposing my religious beliefs on them.

I'd never heard of him, but Wikipedia has an article on him with sources saying he was hired by the drudge report back in 2010, so it looks to check out. The site looks like the drudge report. A bit more modern though, considering the drudge report has had the same look since the 90s. I thought the drudge report was good for the years he worked there, so I figured people might be interested in it.

cnfa1o9,"Agree fully. That is a supply side republican platform when one comes right down to it. 

We need an unapologetic progressive platform for America. We need to recognize that the core problem with the economy is the economy itself. We need to implement policies that compensate for these flaws in effective ways. We need to realign the parties where conservatives are closer to Eisenhower and Nixon rather than Reagan, Bush, and the toxic Tea Party. We need to be a champion of labor, a champion of stronger social safety nets. 

The democrats may be POLITICALLY successful, but you're right, they've lost their soul in the process. Income inequality is at record highs, and the democratic party is too busy celebrating low unemployment and how much better the economy is, sweeping the real problems under the rug. What good are jobs if they're low waged and exploitative? What good is a low unemployment rate if we more or less kill the labor participation rate to get it? We need to change how this economy operates. We need bigger change than just creating work for people to do. 

Heck, I'd argue simply creating work is counterproductive. Work is a means to an end, not an end in itself. In the long term, we should strive to create full unemployment, like John Keynes predicted in 1930. I know this is impractical, but somehow I think creating work for the sake of creating work like we do seems silly. It just justifies the current way of doing things, with is fundamentally flawed from the get go. I'd much rather look to a universal basic income instead. It can start at poverty level. This would end poverty, and supplement wages without increasing the minimum wage. As unemployment increases over time due to technology, this rate can be raised to whatever best balances human happiness and the needs of society. Work should not be an end, it should be a means to an end. And work fails to achieve that end. What we have now is essentially a system of pseudoslavery. People working for their corporate masters at low wages in exploitative conditions just to live. While lower unemployment reduces the amount of dehumanizing begging to get a job, it doesnt change the exploitative nature of the job itself.",democrats,2

...which if you read the story rather than the title, was used in ""minimal amounts"" in shells to create a smokescreen - and to which their own soldiers were likely exposed as well (because that's how gases work - the wind shifts).  If it wasn't hazardous enough to their own soldiers to be an issue, it likely wasn't an issue for the civilians either - but I'm sure there are stories somewhere about Israel shipping PCB laden plastics into the West Bank and Gaza strip to cause cancer there, too.

&gt; The allegedly unintentional attack of a UN school

I remember that one.  The attack was on a terrorist who was fleeing the site of a rocket launch on a motorcyle.  There is actually aerial video of the strike, showing that there was nobody in the courtyard at the time.  The bodies were moved there after the fact - that's a pretty common tactic.  You ought to do a search on the term ""Pallywood"" some time.

&gt; The ""classic example "" are attacks were committed by lone actors, not affiliated with Hamas or the Government.

...which might be believable except the Palestinian Government (which is now also HAMAS) lauds such individuals, provides payments to their families, and exhorts others to follow their example.

&gt; They are not intentionally ruining the economy of their neighbor.

When Israel left Gaza in 2005, the greenhouses there were left intact.  Locals immediately came in and completely destroyed them.  Israeli businesses that employ Palestinians are routinely targets of terrorist attacks.

&gt; They are not building settlements on their neighbors land punish them.

If I were making the decisions there, the next time there was a terrorist attack, every Palestinian would be permanently evicted from the Israeli-controlled areas of Jerusalem and Israel proper, and for each Israeli wounded by a Palestinian terrorist, one square kilometer of the Gaza Strip or West Bank would be annexed by Israel, everything on it razed to the ground, and Palestinians forever barred from living there.  For each Israeli killed, two square kilometers.  Eventually, one way or another, the problem would solve itself.

&gt; They didn't kill civilians by the hundreds in the last war.

Not for lack of trying.

The Israelis have the most advanced weaponry in the world.  Some of it better than US systems.  If they wanted to kill the Palestinians, there wouldn't be a live one in a week.  As it stands, despite claims to the contrary, the vast majority of deaths in the recent conflict were military-aged males - which is completely different than the demographic of the Palestinian population.

&gt; Only because they are less successful do I believe they shouldn't be blamed or held to the same standard

Their lack of success is only due to lack of opportunity.

Here's the measure to use:

- If the Palestinians were to unilaterally disarm tomorrow, destroy their weapons, and renounce all violence - there would be peace.

- If the Israelis were to unilaterally disarm tomorrow, destroy their weapons, and renounce all violence - in a week there wouldn't be a live Jew or Christian in Israel.",Republican,0

cnfqmyl,"My theory is that some astroturfing group is intentionally riling up the hardcore liberal base in the Democratic party to fracture it from within and  feeding the bullshit lie that ""both parties are the same"" to younger citizens who are not interested in politics to prevent them from joining in. 

The Democratic Party is becoming too wide-encompassing. As the second major party, we are taking in everyone who the Republicans are alienating; the poor, the minorities, the young, members of the education system, the progressives, the researchers, the unions, and even some remnants of the older party with the Catholics. This is good in the sense of wide appeal, and in that way more votes, but it is also a key vulnerability: as the party continues to grow it will become more vulnerable to fracture and inter-party debate. Right now the harder progressive wing of the party is dissatisfied and is being encouraged by media sources to refuse to compromise with the greater Democratic party in order for long term change. 

As much as I like Bernie Sanders, there is absolutely no way that he can win a national election with how far left he stands (he is our equivalent of Rand Paul) and as popular as Warren is with the liberals here on Reddit, it is questionable whether or not her policies would be accepted on a national level, especially with the moderate wing of the party finding fault in them. 

True progress happens slowly in the United States, our Democratic Republic was designed this way. The best way to move forward is to gradually shift the public conscience back left after a devastating developmental period during the Reagan administration, which had shifted the American political spectrum heavily right. Obama's administration can be that first step back left if we all manage to work together. Infighting will halt our progress and this is exactly what the opposition wants.",democrats,2

cnftisf,"The nation has gotten itself into a pretty sorry state. The pervasive racketeering that poisons American life from the money-in-politics farce, to the shameless, chiseling medical-pharma cabal, to the SNAP-card and disability rights empire of grift, to the college loan swindle, to the disgusting security state apparatus, to the corporate tyranny of local life and economies, to the delusional techno-narcissism of the media, to the despotic and puerile gender preoccupations of academia — all of it adds up to a society that cares as little for the present as it does for the future. And that’s aside from the pathetic digital device addiction of the generation coming up, and the sheer sordid behavior of the obese tattooed, drug-saturated, pornified masses of adults now forever foreclosed from a purposeful existence or a decent standard of living.

Even physically America is a sorry-ass spectacle: between our decrepitating cities, abandoned Main Streets, gruesome strip-mall highways, repellent and monotonous suburbs, dreary industrial ruins, profaned countryside, and desecrated coastline, there is little left to actually love about This land is Your Land. We’ve made so many collective bad choices about how we live that one can’t help feeling we are simply a wicked people who deserve to be punished.

Whole classes already are, of course. What used to be a working class with aspirations has devolved to the forlorn savagery averred to above. Our thought-leaders are devoid of thought. Our hopes and dreams are absurd sci-fi fantasies prompting us toward robot-assisted suicide. Our political stratagems of recent years accomplish nothing except making more trouble for ourselves while inciting the enmity of people elsewhere.

Obama’s signal failure — aside from letting the banks get away with murder and omitting to counter the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision — has been his total evasion of measures that would prepare the nation for the vast changes in social and economic imperative that will attend the transition out of the techno-industrial era when he is out of office. These include supporting local small scale agriculture (rather than giant corporate agri-biz); promoting and supporting the reconstruction of local economic networks (Main Street business); eliminating multitudinous federal regulations that prevent individuals and small enterprises from operating; closing the hundreds of superfluous US military bases around the world; giving federal support to rebuild the US passenger rail system; promoting walkable communities — especially the re-activation of existing small towns and cities — instead of mindless obeisance to the suburban “home-building” industry (and its step-child in the commercial highway strip development racket) — and truly reforming medical care without the connivance of the insurance racketeers.

Obama and his party can be faulted for fostering the myth that every young person needs a college degree — leading a whole generation into debt penury for no good purpose, while depriving society of a long list of vocational roles and livelihoods based on providing genuine service or value. We will be a nation of unemployed gender studies graduates instead of plumbers, electricians, organic farmers, arborists, carpenters, machinists, nurses and paramedics, small business owners, etc.

This enormous bundles of myths and misplaced expectations for yesterday’s tomorrow prevents the collective national imagination from summoning a revised American Dream based on repairing the massive destruction of recent decades.

The political mood is dark. Both major parties edge toward extinction as the Whigs did in the mid-1850s. The citizenry not sunk in drugs and depravity — that is, people who still read the news in some form and would like to care about their country — deserve a new faction or party that can at least express their discontent with the current situation. They will surely not get this in the generally supposed coming contest between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. I hope they will be so insulted by this dynastic grab that more than one new party will form and make a big stink about it.

&gt; I remember that one... 

[ More than one school was targeted.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/08/-sp-gaza-israeli-strikes-unrwa-schools) 

 
&gt;When Israel left Gaza in 2005, the greenhouses there were left intact. Locals immediately came in and completely destroyed them. Israeli businesses that employ Palestinians are routinely targets of terrorist attacks.

Anecdotal evidence about greenhouses, proving nothing. Israel is an occupying force in the two territories. It is preventing economic materials from getting in or out, causing the people to rely on political machines like Hamas, and smuggling to survive. The basic infrastructure is continually ravaged by war and is unable to be rebuilt because Israel will not allow building materials in the country. As an occupying force Israel has a responsibility to the Palestinian people. Though Hamas and Israel are at war, The Suicide Bombers should not represent the Palestinians the same way a Fighter Jet that 'accidentally' targeted a civilian should represent Israel.

&gt;If I were making the decisions there...

And what happens to Israel if it unjustly kills Palestinians? Do Palestinians get to annex a part of Israel? What if a Mexican kills an American in New York, does the US take a part of Mexico? What if a random black guy kills a random a US government official does the government arbitrarily reposes a piece of a predominately black neighborhood? International Law explicitly prohibits the use of force to capture land. 

&gt;If the Palestinians were to unilaterally disarm tomorrow, destroy their weapons, and renounce all violence - there would be peace.

Lol, neither side wants peace. If Israel wanted peace it wouldn't continue to build settlements. If Hamas wanted peace it would recognize Israel. But neither want that to happen. Israel wants more land and Hamas is butt hurt. 

BTW the PA has no weapons other than a police force, yet Israel builds settlements in the West Bank. Even before the PA merged with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Israel has continually built settlements on West Bank land. 

Israel isn't responsible for just killing civilians in an arguably just war, Israel is also blocking Palestine from becoming a state in anyway it can, like with holding tax transfers to punish Abbas for attempting to join the ICC... thus unilaterally and monetarily punishing the West Bank for attempting to join the International Criminal Court. Abbas and the PA recognized Israel's right to exist, yet they can't exercise that same right to exist in the International Community as anything other than a large refugee camp?

&gt; In a week there wouldn't be a Jew or Christian in Israel?

There are more Palestinian Christians than Israeli... and Muslims are not all bloodthirsty terrorists?

Finally can I get a source on the PA paying the families of terrorists. 


",Republican,2
cng4mdx,"&gt; More than one school was targeted.

Some of them were being used to store weapons (which typically, the UNRWA gave back to HAMAS when it discovered them - I say typically because UNRWA schools are generally used to train Palestinians to hate Israelis, and UNRWA ambulances have been used to transport terrorists to and from attacks).  When you use protected targets for military purposes, they stop being protected targets.

Others were hit by HAMAS rockets that fell short.

&gt; Anecdotal evidence about greenhouses, proving nothing. Israel is an occupying force in the two territories.

It pulled out of Gaza in 2005.

It has offered the Palestinians their own state over and over - the Palestinians keep refusing.  Probably a good move on their part, because if they had their own state and attacked Israel again, Israel would just invade, conquer, and put an end to it.

&gt; And what happens to Israel if it unjustly kills Palestinians? Do Palestinians get to annex a part of Israel?

If they can pull it off, sure.

&gt; What if a Mexican kills an American in New York, does the US take a part of Mexico?

If Mexico were constantly launching rockets into Texas, Arizona, and California, we'd have invaded them long ago and put an end to it.

&gt; BTW the PA has no weapons other than a police force...

Then their police force is launching a heck of a lot of rockets.

You are getting PA and Hamas confused. Hamas is in Gaza, the reason why Israel pulled out of Gaza, was because Hamas's political wing overwhelmingly won the general elections. Since then, Gaza has been blockaded. Hamas is also the one launching attacks. The West Bank is lead by the PA, which is not launching attacks. Though they formed a unity government, that is more a negotiating tactic, to bring Gaza and the West Bank together to the peace negotiations table.

No it isn't.  According to the law of armed conflict, when a school or hospital, or other normally civilian location is used for military purposes, it ceases to be a protected location and becomes a legitimate military target.

&gt; Regardless of pulling out, Gaza is still being blockaded. 

Maybe the Palestinians should talk to Egypt about that.  Egypt permanently closed the border crossings and dug a 50 meter deep trench between Gaza and Egypt because of Palestinian terrorists making attacks in Egypt - and Egypt has seen far fewer attacks than Israel has.

&gt; And the state that Israel offers is a fraction of the size of 1967 lines, and comes with conditions that would likely lead to the immediate failure of the state.

Guess they should have accepted the deal any of the times when it was offered earlier then, when the terms were more favorable.

About as much as the Democrats did by mid-December 1941.

Endless war?  No.  That is what today's Democrats are into.  First you ignore evil for as long as possible so it gets a strong foothold, then you delay action as long as possible to ensure it is able to do as much damage as possible before you engage (if you engage at all).  Once you engage, you do so with surgical airstrikes on abandoned warehouses, etc., all carefully coordinated from Washington, to ensure that you do as little damage as possible while making the US military look weak and ineffective.

...unless the target is a secular leader in an Islamic or Middle-eastern country (preferably one we consider an ally).  Then you do everything you can do ensure they are deposed and replaced by terrorists, short of actually invading.

It's horrible, I know, but while this is happening you have protesters holding up traffic (including EMTs), harassing people in restaurants trying to eat, and all competing for personal fame by proving who can be the biggest activist for a pretty unfounded cause.

cnh3f9q,"&gt; WW2 did not last nearly as long as Iraq.

Correct.  WW2 was the last war we fought to win.

To be more clear on that point, you don't end a war by killing the enemy soldiers or destroying the enemy armies.

Every enemy soldier and army is created by a civilian population that believes in the goal they think that soldier and army are fighting for.

If all you do is destroy the armies and kill the soldiers, the civilian population will make more.

There are two ways to end a war.  The first way is to expose the goal desired by the civilian population as a lie, in such a way that they collectively cannot help but believe it is a lie.  Demoralized, they will stop supporting the soldiers and armies.

The second way to end a war is by making the very thought of it continuing for one more day so horrible to the civilian population that creates those soldiers and armies, that they will do anything, give up anything to make it stop.

When you do either one of those, the war is over.  Anything else is just a pause until there are more soldiers available.",Republican,1

Some of the things you don't do with a conquered country are immediately turn the government back over to the locals, allow the citizenry to remain armed, or the borders to be unsecured.  We did all of those things.  Even from there it might have been recoverable (though over a very long, painful time), had Obama not pulled the troops out due to failing to renew the status of forces agreement.  Once he did that, it was a lost cause.

Not exactly.  Reagan traded arms in 1985-1986, originally through an Israeli intermediary, to ""moderate elements"" in Iran that opposed the Ayatollah Khomeini, to assist in Iran's fight against Iraq.  This faction offered to get hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon released to prove their seriousness.  Reagan initially rejected the plan until the faction provided proof that they opposed terrorism and had fought against it.

Hostages were released as the arms sales took place.

Oliver North came up with the plan to use part of the proceeds from the sale to fund the Contras, who were at the time rebelling against the communist government of Nicaragua.  The plan was approved by Admiral Poindexter, the National Security Adviser, without Reagan's knowledge.  The Contras had been being funded by the US government with the approval of Congress up until October 1984.

Congressional approval for funding to the Contras was restored in October 1986.",Republican,1

The weapons he claimed they were using were from a buried bunker that had been been wrecked and buried by the UN inspectors 20 years ago.    The weapons that were buried were considered so compromised that even if the bunker was entered, the inspectors said the weapons could not even withstand transportation without spilling their contents.

You changed it now to 2 years at a 4 year college, but an Associates degree is far better than none in terms of earning power.

There are lots of programs that still need to be funded (like universities), but they held off on those to fund the ones that needed immediate help and would have a much quicker return on investment (like infrastructure) that will immediately create jobs and start fixing the state.

This is even more drastic in community colleges. 31% compression rate according to this article, though I have admittedly seen marginally higher figures.

I don't disagree that if everyone tried college we would see lower ratios of graduates to enrollment.  But if we see a net gain in 2 year degrees, the improvement would help those people a lot.  It would also help everyone who employs those people and all the people who depend on those people too.

cnk7gpv,"If Americans were honest with themselves they would acknowledge that the Republic is no more. We now live in a police state. If we do not recognize and resist this development, freedom and prosperity for all Americans will continue to deteriorate. All liberties in America today are under siege. It didn’t happen overnight. It took many years of neglect for our liberties to be given away so casually for a promise of security from the politicians. The tragic part is that the more security was promised — physical and economic — the less liberty was protected.With cradle-to-grave welfare protecting all citizens from any mistakes and a perpetual global war on terrorism, which a majority of Americans were convinced was absolutely necessary for our survival, our security and prosperity has been sacrificed.It was all based on lies and ignorance. Many came to believe that their best interests were served by giving up a little freedom now and then to gain a better life.The trap was set. At the beginning of a cycle that systematically undermines liberty with delusions of easy prosperity, the change may actually seem to be beneficial to a few. But to me that’s like excusing embezzlement as a road to leisure and wealth — eventually payment and punishment always come due. One cannot escape the fact that a society’s wealth cannot be sustained or increased without work and productive effort. Yes, some criminal elements can benefit for a while, but reality always sets in. Reality is now setting in for America and for that matter for most of the world. The piper will get his due even if “the children” have to suffer. The deception of promising “success” has lasted for quite a while. It was accomplished by ever-increasing taxes, deficits, borrowing, and printing press money. In the meantime the policing powers of the federal government were systematically and significantly expanded.

He performed a similar service, with more success, on behalf of the Cuban militant Orlando Bosch, for whom he sought a presidential pardon from his father. The boastful murderer of dozens of innocent people — and a prosecution target of the U.S. Justice Department — Bosch deserved a pardon about as much as the worst jihadi in Gitmo. But his sponsors were the same Cuban-Americans in Miami who had fostered Jeb’s real estate business there, so he ignored the Republican attorney general’s denunciation of Bosch as an “unreformed terrorist.”

Yeah, George and that gosh-darned media ruining things for Jeb.

Honestly. I don't mind it whenever people have points of view that counter my own but if you're not educated enough or eloquent enough to adequately explain what you're trying to say…people are just going to mock you.

I've always hated Bush, particularly as the failed leader he was but I don't ever remember even *one* person suggesting that he was a communist. Want to know why? Because most democrats are educated enough to realize that communism has nothing to do with the Patriot Act (you're suggesting there is some connection). The Patriot Act was a series of legislation meant to protect America from terrorists and, yes, there were *many* bullshit laws included that impeded on the rights of Americans but it was a republican-born piece of legislation that was passed by some democrats who didn't even have a chance to read it.

And that has to do with communism *how*? 

Or are you suggesting that because republicans are ignorant enough to genuinely believe that Obama is a socialist (for trying to help the poor and middle class and to get the ultra wealthy to pay their fair share of tax obligations) that the democrats must be equally uninformed and uneducated.

Not the case, I can assure you.

If classes can't be filled, can we combine students? Yes, the CTE Academy in Sioux Falls does just this.  It serves the three major high schools of Sioux Falls (about 6,000 students if I'm correct) and also opens CTE courses to students from the rural schools in the area. 

Are high schools going to buy the equipment? With things like welding, the supplies may very well be donated by companies who would benefit from the workers created by the program.  Otherwise, as exemplified by the CTE Academy, supplies could be collectively bought to minimize costs-per-school. ",Republican,3
cnm7mbi,"First, self driving tractor trailers are still about 15-20 years away from being road ready and even then the prediction is that the self-drive will only work on highways/interstate situations. Even then, someone has to be there to load/unload the products and safeguard against theft. Second, a truck driver can make anywhere from $40k-$55k in his first year doing local and regional work. I paid a driver $106,000 in 2012. If he had been a driver with only 1-5 years of experience, his pay still would have been $75k-$85k. The reason these jobs pay so well is because people aren't entering the market. Right now there is a need in the US for anywhere from 60,000-120,000 truck drivers and 15,000 mechanics or more. These jobs aren't going away in a few years, maybe 50, but not right now. 
Third, if these kids aren't succeeding in high school why make them compete for the same jobs that the kids with better grades are going after? Want to talk about stacking the deck?  I see vocational training as a path to success for a lot of kids who aren't built or have no desire to become doctors or engineers, but still want to have a better life than working paycheck to paycheck. Giving someone with C's in high school a free two more years of what is essentially high school does nothing for them. It just delays the realization that those at the bottom of that very broad standard can't compete for those same jobs and are going to have to find another way in life. Think about how easy it is in a public school to obtain a C average which is basically just showing up. My buddy teaches in a high school in Dallas and told me he was not allowed to fail his students out of AP classes, even when one of them failed to complete 70% of the course. 
    The goal should be to help these kids find a path to good jobs where they can make enough to provide for a family and live a good life. Making high school last 6 years doesn't do that whereas vocational training could seriously help, especially when paired with basic business classes and other practical skills.  Of course, the types of vocational training is going to change over time and with the demand, but a robot isn't going to come to your house and pump your septic tank or install your new ac unit anytime soon. Also, who is going to fix my new self-driving trucks in a few years?  
I agree that you have to invest in public education but the jobs you are talking about automating are the jobs you for which you don't need vocational training.

Speaking of which, I'm not going to play your double-standard game of me having to prove why you're a liar when you can freely call hundreds if not thousands of people liars.  Your attempt to force a tu quoque situation is pompous.  But in any event, I think I've at least established half the burden by simply pointing to your own admission that your claims are entirely spurious.

[Here are the rule changes](http://carolinalibertypac.com/2013/04/final-rules-outcome-of-the-rnc-spring-meeting/) from the spring 2013 meeting.

[In the January 2014 meeting, ](http://ogreexposed.org/rnc-rules-disaster/#winter2014) at the request and aggressive push of Chairman Priebus, the RNC voted to approve a package of rules changes that effectively shortened the primary season and severely punishes states that do not comply by significantly reducing the number of delegates they can send to the Convention. Remember the only way the RNC can do this is to force each state Republican Party to comply with the threat of severe sanctions.

The shortening of the primary season will irreparably harm the ability of liberty Republicans and Tea Party favored candidates to compete for the presidential nomination.

WHERE WERE THE FUCKING DEMOCRATS TAKING OBAMA'S BACK DURING THE MIDTERMS? Those fools lost their shitty seats in congress because they were too stupid to *prove* that Obama has improved the economy.

Americans are *not* very smart. We've proven that time and time again so that's not really up for debate. 

But THEY BOUGHT THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW OBAMA HAS DONE A POOR JOB whenever the reality is nothing could be further from the truth. 

But what did democrats do? They ran. They hid. They avoided. And those are the idiots who lost elections to republicans who somehow convinced some of the dumbest people on the planet that the economy is ""bad"" even though it's one of the strongest economies we have had in about 15 years.

Why can Americans not figure that out? Really? You don't get why a bunch of poor people who constantly elect *rich* people who *hate* poor people can't understand that the economy is getting better?

Idiocy. Lack of education. Lack of information. Inability to understand simple basic economic principals? Pick one. But somehow the republicans were able to convince Americans that things are horrible and Americans were stupid enough to believe it because democrats were too ignorant and too afraid to simply put the economic *facts* into a presentable form and let people understand the stark difference between the economy that GW Bush left America and the economy that Obama created for America that is miles, miles and *miles* better than the greatest recession America has suffered through that GW Bush left for Obama.

Obama has fixed it. Make no mistake. It won't get much better than it is now because the republicans have ushered in a new era of anti-worker, pro-corporation, anti-middle class, anti-equalty, anti-American legislation that will likely never be reversed.

But all of the bad shit that republicans cannot get over right now are the direct result of the rich assholes they constantly elect into office.

Pseudo-scholarly, but not overly informative:

A more worldly view:

Our state's population is actually not that conservative. There are more [Democrats than Republicans](http://floridavoterfile.com/statistics/FLORIDA.HTM) in this state.


Our government meanwhile is dominated by Republicans and by dominated I mean Republicans can do anything they want with no negative repercussions. The Republicans do not just have a simple majority in both houses of our state legislature, [they have super majorities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Legislature) in both. This means that even if we were able to boot out Rick Scott (who is considered to be a pretty horrible governor for many reasons and is also a Republican) the Republicans would still be able to override any veto that a Democratic governor could have made. 

Republicans are able to maintain this control for 4 big reasons

1. [Gerrymandering.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/11/florida-political-maps-republicans-redrawn)

2. [Liberals being concentrated in large cities makes it harder to avoid packing them into a few districts.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/why-democrats-cant-win.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1)

3. Like elsewhere in the country, liberal leaning constituents don't turnout for midterm elections.

4. Republicans have implemented various voting suppression measures ranging from [purging voter rolls](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/appeals-court-rules-florida-voter-purge-violated-federal-law/2173054) to [blocking the use of college voting sites](http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/state-blocks-use-of-uf-student-union-as-early-voting-center/2164465?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter) that all disproportionately target liberal leaning constituents. 

The Florida Man nonsense is just a meme. Florida is about as weird as any other US state but the 2000 election colored the reaction to the typical offbeat story if it came from Florida because the 2000 election was so ridiculous that hearing another ridiculous story from the state makes it seem like Florida is just a crazy place.

TL; DR: Gerrymandering by Republicans is why our state seems so crazy when the population of our state is really just a bunch of normal Americans.

&gt;The __Florida Legislature__ is the two houses that act as the [state legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States\)) of the [U.S. state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state) of [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida). The [Florida Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Constitution) states that ""The legislative power of the state shall be vested in a legislature of the State of Florida,"" composed of a Senate and House of Representatives.  The legislature is seated at the [Florida State Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Capitol) in [Tallahassee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida).

&gt;Composed of 160 state legislators term-limited to eight years, the state legislature meets beginning in March for a period not to exceed 60 calendar days. Special sessions are called as needed.

&gt;Its statutes, called ""chapter laws"" or generically as ""[slip laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_law)"" when printed separately, are compiled into the *[Laws of Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Florida)* and are called ""[session laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_laws)"".  The *[Florida Statutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Statutes)* are the [codified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law\)) statutory laws of the state.

That is after all, what 'beyond a reasonable doubt' is all about, and most reasonable people are going to be reluctant to vote for a death penalty verdict if they are unsure.

Any ratepayer in virtually every insurance plan subsidizes anyone with claims against that insurance plan. If you have auto insurance and have no claims this year then you are subsidizing everyone who did have claims. Low risk insureds always subsidize higher risk insureds. This has always been true for every type of insurance: health, auto, homeowner, casualty, etc.

You're complaining about a fundamental necessity of insurance. Attempting to pin that on Obama is ludicrous. Health insurance plans have always used lower risk beneficiaries to pay for higher risk beneficiaries. Healthy people pay for sick. Younger people pay for old. I've been paying for my own health insurance since 1989 and that was how it was the entire time.

You don't seem to be aware that premiums for people my age are a lot higher than they are for people in their twenties.

&gt;__Fred S. Karger__ (born January 31, 1950) is an American [political consultant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_consultant), [gay rights activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_rights_activist) and [watchdog](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/watchdog), former actor, and former candidate for the [Republican nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States\)_presidential_primaries,_2012) for the [2012 US Presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012).  His unsuccessful run for the 2012 Republican nomination for President made him America’s first openly gay Republican presidential candidate.   Although he has not held elected or public office, Karger has worked on nine presidential campaigns and served as a senior consultant to the campaigns of Presidents [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan), [George H. W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush) and [Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford).   Karger was a partner at the Dolphin Group, a California campaign consulting firm.   He retired after 27 years and has since worked as an activist on gay rights causes, from protecting the gay bar The Boom to using his organization [Californians Against Hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Californians_Against_Hate) to investigate [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints) (LDS Church) and the [National Organization for Marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Marriage)'s campaigns to repeal the state's [same-sex marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Maine) law.  His running for the Republican nomination for president made him the first openly gay presidential candidate from a major political party in American history.

A lot of folks do support gay marriage... however I do believe there's value in quite a few traditional roles (a working father will almost always be better for a child than just a welfare check.) So... maybe focus less on stopping Gay Marriage and more on things like keeping families together (the number of children being raised in single parent homes is rising, if I remember correctly), allowing people to practice their faith in public places, that sorta thing.

Hell, overturning a lot of B.S. the radfems have been pushing would probably earn a nice amount of support from moderates.

Every layer of the process makes it as hard as possible, demands proof after proof, does everything it can to find an excuse to reject.

As for the towns where a quarter of the population is on disability, I'd wager those are towns where there's very little genuine work.  Not because all the healthy people went and got disability, but because the disabled were one of the few groups who didn't have to move away when the work dried up.

As for how the number of people could expand so much, I tender a suggestion; the actual rate of disability has increased quite dramatically, along with the lousy economic environment giving people who were sick but marginally able to do work without getting fired too often a strong incentive to fall back on disability when there wasn't any more employment out there for them, there not being enough jobs to go around even for healthy, educated, productive people.

How could the actual rate of disability increase?  A combination of factors.  Aging population means a higher percentage who are disabled as the likelihood of disability increases with age, for one.  Another is poverty.  Not having health insurance (because of poverty) makes treatable things into chronic conditions because people can't afford to get them fixed when they're small, treatable problems and wait.  Poverty also causes a fair number of chronic conditions that wouldn't exist at all with a decent living environment.  Poverty has been growing rapidly, so anything that poverty causes would also be expected to increase.  Finally, as medical technology has advanced a lot more stuff that used to be fatal has become survivable, but not necessarily in a way that leaves much of a life.  That's been an ongoing factor in raising disability rates for a long time, and it hasn't stopped in the last 15 years.

Does that make for enough cases to explain the increase?  I don't have the numbers to do the math.  If you can dig them up, I'd be curious to see.",democrats,3

cnrw8oa,"I've recently watched two people's struggles to get on disability. One had been in and out of mental institutions for the past decade. The most recent visit, she had multiple electroconvulsive therapy treatments (shock treatments). Her memory was royally fucked up, and her thought process was deeply disturbed. It took her *months* to get approved. In the meantime, she couldn't take care of herself--her husband had to have her legally declared incompetent and he took over everything in the household (bills, groceries, all that kind of thing). She couldn't get her own groceries, was deemed incompetent to even carry a checkbook and write out a check, but someone she was supposed to work? What would she have done if her husband had decided he couldn't deal with it and left?

The other person had diabetic nephropathy. He was in constant pain, couldn't drive, could barely walk. He applied and was denied. He eventually lost his toes, applied again, was denied again. He lost his leg up to his knee, applied again, and this time was approved.

He had to lose his fucking *leg* before he could get disability payments.

I know, I know, anecdotal crap. And I'm sure there's some fraud going on in the system. I just don't think it's as prevalent as some people believe. It's easy to look at someone and say ""Hey, that person can work."" But you can't tell by looking if someone had multiple shock treatments and can't even function as an adult.

I told him it was the day I became ill and was forced into understanding the pain that people have to endure. I had to be taught empathy in therapy, my family doesnt even know what that word means.

Do you think the behavior stems from low self-esteem? They have to put others down to build themselves up? They don't want to be seen as ""failures,"" so they have to point out how much better they think they are?

Or maybe fear. I think fear's a big part. Things are changing, relatively quickly, and some some people are very frightened. They wouldn't want to admit it, so they turn into a bully to look tough. Like the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz.

In some cases, people did exactly what they were told would bring success. They did what their parents did, they worked hard, but they still got left behind, and so they grew very bitter. I can understand that, I guess. I can't understand why they would continue to vote for the policies that led to this point, rather than join with others to make things better for themselves (unions, for example). Fear, I guess. Who wants to admit being wrong?

My brother's racism has come out full force since 2008. He's made some bad decisions, but I guess rather than own up to them, it's easier to blame someone else. To him, it looks like white men are losing ground, but what he's really seeing is that white men are no longer privileged over others--their mistakes aren't so easily rectified, because they're not getting special treatment any longer.

The CDC already studies this, under the umbrella of ""trauma"".  They - and numerous other medical organizations - collect data on trauma cases and issue advice on treatment protocols. 

They also study acute and chronic illnesses related to shooting, such as increased risk of hearing loss and exposure to chemical propellants, primers, lubes, solvents, etc.

As you understand it. As I understand it, the FBI collects a wide variety of data on each and every shooting in the nation and is in the best position to advise policy makers on criminal gun use. 

&gt;The issue, seems to me, is not really who should do it, so much, but that such research seems to be lacking,

I disagree with you wholeheartedly. Determining who should be doing it is the sole issue at hand. There is no **medical** reason to differentiate between a criminally violent person who has gained access to and used a gun from a criminally violent person who has gained access to and used a knife. The CDC should be (and is) equally interested in the ""criminally violent"" aspects of both people. 

The federal-level organization concerned with studying the differences between gun crime and knife crime is the FBI, not the CDC.

 If we continue to polarize independents and moderate Democrats by shifting further to the right, that may bode well in the primaries, but that is a failing strategy come general election.

This idea of a far-right candidate is an angle that's been worked over and over each election cycle, and yet the 'moderate' candidate is the one who emerges each time. The problem becomes, however, that 'moderate' candidate oftentimes spends so much time in the primaries pandering to this smaller far-right base that it becomes increasingly difficult to then shift back to their actual ideals for all voters come general election. 

I can understand how the idea of this far-right candidate seems like the answer when we see candidates like Mitt Romney, John McCain fall short in the general election. However, I personally don't see it as a failure of not being 'conservative' enough. It becomes an issue of not relating to all voters (read: conservatives, independents, and yes, even Democrats). So, the idea of then electing an individual even further separated from all voters is just digging a deeper hole. If we could showcase a moderate candidate's ideals from the primaries rather than a large contest of 'who is more conservative than the other', that would provide a better outcome that would benefit both the party at large, as well as the greater country.

The only way this concept makes sense is if there is some large and untapped conservative voting bloc that refuses to vote for anyone who is not a strong conservative. I.E., they stay home for decades at a time unless their candidate is significantly further to the right than the rest of the country. 

If that's true, they're deeply irrational, since however moderate McCain or Romney are, both men are right of Obama. Staying home to wait for a more conservative candidate means continually empowering the left. But I don't think this bloc actually exists (not is numbers more significant than their counterparts on the liberal side).

The issue is that Republicans are dividing into their constituent camps: Social conservatives and economic conservatives who otherwise have little to do with each other, along with conservative non-interventionists. These camps don't have much ideological common ground. That's why it's so hard for the GOP to put candidates through the primaries that can appeal to the middle *and* to the party.

Compare that to Democrats, who, while not having a strong ideological core, are at least less at odds with each other about what they support (vaguely in favor of government social intervention and economic redistribution). They more naturally settle on moderates.

If the Republicans want to win, they need either 1) a major economic or foreign policy disaster on Obama's watch this year or next, or 2) to drop one of their major social issue poison policies that alienates large voting blocs (such as immigration opposition, drug opposition, or gay marriage opposition).",Republican,2

&gt; One reason for the larger crowd – Dugan cut off preregistration for the three-day event Thursday after the total surged past 1,000 – is that this year’s convention isn’t restricted to Tea Party members and their families. The event is open to the public.

cnux5se,"This article makes a fundamental mistake aside from relative sizes of Muslim populations, by equating Jindal's statement with Al-Sisi's.

Jindal is saying that Muslim leaders must condemn violence as being Unislamic.  That the violence is outside Islam.  He wonders why they do not.  

They do not condemn it because it is not Unislamic.  The Qur'an specifically authorizes and requires what those committing violence in the name of Allah are doing.  The Imams and Muslim leaders cannot condemn it because it would make them blasphemers and heretics (at least where the various means of lying condoned by Islam are not employed).

While Jindal's speech is politically incorrect in that it associates radical Islam with Islam, there's nothing there that involves personal risk to him.

Al-Sisi does not say the violence is Unislamic.  At considerable personal risk, he says that Islam must reform so that the violence is no longer a part of it.  In doing so, he admits to what Muslims and those willing to see Islam for what it is already know: that it is not a religion of peace, but rather that it condones and even requires violence.

Al-Sisi goes on to say that the rest of the world views Islam as a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world.

Lastly, he says that if Muslims don't get over wanting to kill the rest of us, it may result in the destruction of the religion.

To be fair, Islam offers other options for non-Muslims besides death.  There is slavery, subjugation, or conversion.  ...but that only applies if the Muslims win.  The adherents of Islam are both outnumbered and horribly outgunned.  If it comes to a straight up fight, they will lose, and we are rapidly approaching a time when the people of the rest of the world will begin to force their governments to fight the war that the Muslims began, if Islam doesn't reform and call a halt to it.

Al-Sisi is a general, and a politician.  Egypt's military has long been the power that prevented Egypt's governments from destroying their country.  He knows the signs of danger, and by speaking out the way he did, he is trying to avert it in the only way open to him.

That bears little resemblance to Jindal's comments.

For Islam to reform in the way Al-Sisi suggests would require fundamental changes in the structure of the religion.  It would require that Muslims no longer completely follow the dictates of the Qur'an, and that Mohammed no longer be seen as the perfect Muslim to be emulated in all things.  That makes Al-Sisi a reformer, in a religion where suggesting either of those things is a quick ticket to execution.  You have to admire him for at least making the attempt given that, even though he knows it is almost certainly doomed to fail.

That said, I don't think it matters a great deal.  Religions don't reform when they are winning, and Islam is still winning.  If it continues on this course and Jindal ends up in a position where the decisions fall to him, he will have to either fight or become a victim along with everyone he is responsible for the welfare of.",Republican,1

And just because Obama is proposing that your lords and masters to whom you are sycophants pay their fair share doesn't mean you should fall on your swords, you lot of ignorant lice. 

Do me a favor if you're one of these uneducated types. Do a google search and look up tax rates for the wealthy by YEAR. Go all the way back to the Great Depression and then compare those rates to TODAY'S rates (particularly what the poor pay vs. what the ultra wealthy pay and paid). 

THEN, go back and look at the size of the middle class during all of those time periods.

America was a great country with the largest middle class because we had AN AGREEMENT with the wealthy: ""We will allow you to make millions and millions of dollars in our country. We will facilitate a system that allows you to use all of our resources in which to do this BUT you have to pay a percentage of that back to US, the government that established the system that you use and who protect and maintain that system (capitalism).

And in the beginning those people were ECSTATIC to pay their taxes. Why? If you're paying a lot of taxes, it meant you were making a shit TON of money. 

Over time, the republicans stood up to defend the 'poor, helpless, ultra wealthy' and drove tax rates down regularly to the point where the wealthiest people in the world are paying a lower tax rate than some of the poorest. That's the truth. 

This obsession the GOP has with the wealthy was a one way street, the republicans literally only existed to protect the wealthy in ways they never needed to be protected. And as the rich continue to get richer and pay the lowest rates in the history of the nation, the poor continue to get poorer and to suffer. And all that TRICKLE DOWN that was going to raise all the wages and make the nation a better, stronger place…yeah, that NEVER happened and never will.


These rich people sold your ass a useless bill of goods and you bought it. Now they continue to use the poor as an army of foot soldiers to do the bidding of the rich.

And most people with an education realize that an opinion is absolutely worthless because it's nothing more than a personal belief that hasn't been substantiated by fact or history. 

For example, I think Reagan was the worst president *of my lifetime*, at least. He oversaw the dismantling of the middle class, he purposely broke unions, he was involved in illegal affairs (Iran-Contra) and he coddled the wealthy while attacking the poor and middle class.

The dying middle class that we have now *started* with Reagan as far as republicans being an aggressive party *against* the poor and fighting specifically for the handful of wealthy who get them elected. They pledged their allegiance only to the rich and corporations. 

Obama has certainly saved this economy after it was nearly completely destroyed by Bush &amp; Co. If you compare the facts from 2009 to 2015 and look at the GDP growth, increase in production, the decrease in unemployment, the Dow Jones average…

Obama took a really shitty economy that was handed to him by Bush (who presided over the downfall of the U.S. economy…the worst recession since the Great Depression) and he has absolutely turned it around with a lot of efforts that he was able to enact *despite* republicans, certainly not *because* of them.

All of these efforts, we were told by the right that they wouldn't work and wouldn't pay off. Romney ran on a pledge of making unemployment under 6.2% by the end of his *second* term…Obama *already* has bested that and still has 2 years to go on his term.

Bush started 2 unnecessary wars, we know now that he lied about the reasons he started them (the laughable WMD bullshit), he lied to Americans, he lied to the international community, he lied to Congress and he spent TRILLIONS with those wars. 

The laughable part of the ""conservative"" party these days is that they're more likely to spend more money than the democrats but one thing is for sure: Obama *showed results*. 

When Bush was in office, people lost jobs by the millions, people lost their life savings in the stock market, people lost HOMES. THAT is what Bush presided over. Obama came in with his own ideas that republicans fought him on tooth and nail and STILL created a pretty fucking dramatic and quick recovery.

History will prove that Obama is more impressive than Reagan EASILY.

The problem isn't in the supply side and it hasn't been for decades.   The problem is that the demand side is weak because the middle class has seen their wages stagnate since Reagan.  Kinda hard to create demand for goods and services (which means JOBS)  when your customers can't afford them because you've taken what USED to end up in the workers pockets and stuffed it into the pockets of the CEO's and executives.

cnwmb0r,"&gt; The sequester is not what I would call ""intelligent spending cuts.""

The Sequester, were it a hard limit, is an incentive for Congress to work together to come up with ""intelligent spending cuts"".  If they can't do so, then the spending cuts happen anyway.  That said, you are right - the sequester wasn't intelligent - it required that half the dollar amount of the cuts come out of 1/4 of the Federal budget.

&gt; A balanced budget amendment would be horrible. The federal government needs to be able to spend more money than it takes in.

Short of an unexpected major war or national emergency affecting most of the US, no it does not.  We did just fine in 1957 using 6% of revenues to *pay down* the debt.  Granted, that was the last time that happened.

&gt; Actually the amnesty programs of the past did fix the problem temporarily.

They fixed nothing, because the borders weren't secured (as the Democrats promised to do after the first one in 1986 and then reneged).  All they did was change ""illegal"" to ""legal"" and create new demand for illegal labor.

&gt; But honestly I wasn't talking about an amnesty program as much as I was talking about actual reform of how the immigration system works. To spell out what I mean really obviously, we need to lower the barriers to becoming a citizen to almost nothing.

Any nation can only absorb so many new people at a time.  The US allows more than a million people per year to legally immigrate - more than any other country.  In 2006, it was 1.2 million - more than all other countries combined.  We already cannot employ the majority of our working age population in full time jobs, or even 2/3 in part time jobs.  We are developing large enclaves of people who refuse to assimilate to American culture, because we are importing too many at a time, and our social safety net is unaffordable.  The reason why the barriers to (legal) immigration and citizenship are as high as they are (despite the fact that we don't enforce many of them) is because there are far, far more people who want to come here than we can absorb.  It takes as long as it does, because there are many more than the 1 million per year that we allow who would come if they could.

We *could* stand to reform our immigration system - but we need to do it in a way that is beneficial to the US.  That means not allowing *more* unskilled and uneducated immigrants into the US, but fewer.  We need to take a page from Australia, and allow *only* those immigrants who can be a demonstrable asset to the US to come here, and require that they demonstrably assimilate before they are allowed to become citizens.  We need to cut our immigration to virtually nil while we try to assimilate the 41 million foreign-born people already here.

&gt; Most economists suggest that making it easier to be a citizen does nothing but boost the economy.

When there is a labor shortage, that is absolutely true.  Does it look like we have a labor shortage to you?  90,000 jobs out of our monthly job creation are going to immigrants, when we need to get our own citizens employed again.

It is hypocritical only if one assumes the only way the government can cause wages to rise is by raising the minimum wage.

&gt; I mean, how the fuck does Government incentive private industry to raise wages?

The methodology is fairly straightforward - it is just antithetical to Democrat policies.

1. Deport the 12-20 million illegal aliens and secure the border, thus eliminating the excess in the low-skilled and unskilled labor force, where most minimum wage jobs are.

2. Reform the immigration system to cut legal immigration by 90+% via methods similar to those of Australia - allowing in only immigrants who will demonstrably benefit the US, and preventing the immigration of more unskilled and uneducated persons.

3. Make the US more attractive to business by cutting business taxes by half and moving regulatory authority from the Federal Government to state governments.

By creating more jobs in the US and removing the excess labor that has no legal right to be here, you create competition among employers for employees - which raises wages.",Republican,-2

I have nothing against Romney but I've always viewed him as a flawed candidate. Against an established Democrat he never has and never will have any chance of winning the presidency, why more Republican 'strategists' don't see this I have no idea. For a Republican to win the White House they have to win both the 'Establishment' republicans (Rich, Leaders of Industry, Those with influence) as well as the middle America Republicans (Joe America who makes $50K a year, your everyday people). The problem with Romney is that he has/had the support of the establishment Republicans and in turn was force fed to the middle America Republicans. The middle-America Republicans will turnout in numbers but only for someone they can relate to, someone who discusses issues that affect them, someone that has genuine personality. Romney's problem has always been that he can't relate to the middle America Republicans, I think in the last election his team assumed that the middle America Repubs would turn out in droves for Romney who was given the blessing by the establishment Republicans but it didn't happen and he lost because of it. For a Republican to win the presidency they need full backing from the establishment (for money, exposure, campaigning, support) but more importantly they need to be able to relate to the middle America Republican voters, they need to have a personality, a life's work that people relate to, but this person has to be genuine, people can see right through someone who is 'trying' to hard if you will. Romney has never been relatable to most Americans, and that's not because of his pedigree or history, look at GW Bush, the middle America Republicans loved him and turned out in droves to get him elected. GW came from a long established political family, he has plenty of money, he went to Yale, not that much different from Romney as far as pedigree but GW had flaws and people could relate to him. GW spoke off the cuff, he was a bit of a wild child growing up, he had a drinking problem when he was younger, but in my opinion that only served him, it made him look more human. This all goes back to winning the middle America Republican vote, Ronald Reagan did it (arguably better than anyone else), Bush senior did it (on the coat tails of Reagan but then was beat by the much more personable Clinton), and the last to do it was GW Bush. I don't think Jeb will have any problem winning over the middle America Republicans, there will surely still be many Republicans that are somewhat sour on GW but I don't think that will translate into 'no' votes for Jeb. Jeb can relate to the masses, he's soft spoken but personable, and most importantly he can win Florida and pull a lot of the hispanic vote. The key again however is those middle America suburban living Republicans who firmly stand behind a candidate so long as they can relate to them. Romney never has and never will be able to fully rally this subgroup of voters and it didn't help last cycle when Romney was shoved down everyone's throats by the establishment. Jeb has the key ability to garner support from the middle class and in turn win the presidency.",Republican,1

I got to tell you, it's comfortable to end up with what got me into this thread in the first place:  an argument so flimsy it'd be knocked over by a stiff wind, supported only by spurious accusations, baseless assumptions, and attempts to vilify the opponent.  

But just in case you want to read one last thing before your victory lap / retreat:

(1)(a) If you aren't familiar with how the ACA works (i.e. as a tax that you get out of when you buy health insurance), you should read up; but we could instead skip over that one and move to any of the other examples I discussed.  Unfortunately you conveniently ignored each and every one of them.  The dig about uninsured people in America was really creative though:  so, is that arguing that there shouldn't be tax provisions related to health insurance or what?


(1)(b) Just for starters, you do realize you're supporting an argument that *lower* taxes on the middle class will drive a consumer driven economy and create jobs.  That position makes it a little tough for you to genuinely argue that it's plausible that the corollary is false:  that *higher* taxes don't have an effect on job creation.  

In any event, take it from the current darling of the left, Thomas Piketty, who is not so absurd to argue that taxes have no affect on growth - for him (like anyone not so shallow to be all surface) it's a question of where the trade-offs are.  But since we're just being obstinate jerk-offs instead of engaging in a discussion - I'll deny reality too now and ask you prove through historical data that lowering taxes on the middle class will do anything.  It's not moving the ball forward, is it?

I don't know who said that raising the minimum would bankrupt businesses.  Raising the minimum and making no other changes will cause businesses to reduce hours and lay off employees.  That's just simple economics, and even the CBO recognizes that and has said so.

&gt; ...how will these same businesses suddenly be able to afford paying higher wages just because there are no immigrants?

If wages rise because there is full employment and businesses are having to compete for labor, then there is more substantially more discretionary income available to the population (because the vast majority of the working age population is working), so businesses are *doing* more business.  People who are employed full time have more discretionary income than those living off the social safety net.

It is the difference for business between the cost of their labor being arbitrarily raised while their income remains the same, and their having to pay their labor more to keep them because everyone has so much business there is a higher demand for that labor.

As to climate change, you won't find many Republicans that will say the climate is not changing.  There's just some disagreement on the causes.

cny7mx2,"More of a lurker than anything, here to throw my opinion in the ring.

Yes, in some sense of the word. You can vote republican, while still disagreeing on some of the issues. I did so in the past election, because the republican candidates were more oriented around the issues I find myself supporting than the other candidates in the election were. If it were the other way around, I wouldn't hesitate to vote democrat. Let me explain it again, lest anyone think I am a liberal. I vote on the basis of which candidate conforms more to the issues I find myself supporting. Rather than try and find an entire party for you to associate with, vote on the basis of who the candidate is, and what they stand for. You WILL have to sacrifice some of your values in order to find a candidate that fits you the best, so I would start off by looking into what you care about most. If a candidate supports your side of the issue most important to you, then you need to look at what else they are for and against, and try and look at the costs versus the gains of voting for that candidate. Keep in mind, the candidate may change their stance once reaching Washington, so voting for someone because of one of their stances is a risky move.

As for climate change specifically, pretty much everyone agrees that the climate is changing, but the debate is focused on the cause. You didn't state what you think the cause is, so I will explain. Keep in mind, I don't much follow the climate change debate, so I am not the most qualified individual, and you should take what I say with a MASSIVE grain of salt.

The Republican stance generally favors saying that humans are not responsible for climate change, and increased greenhouse gases, but they do admit that it is happening, and needs to be addressed, but in a much different manner than that of democrats. They tend to lean more towards a lack of regulation. To be honest, I'm not sure what they propose as a solution, which just goes to show that you should not take what I am saying as the be-all-end-all. I can't stress this enough, while I am a political scientist, I focus more on the party aspect, and the government as a whole, rather than specific issues. Take what I am saying with a MASSIVE grain of salt.

As for the democrats, they mostly agree that climate change is the cause of humans, and want to regulate industry heavily in order to fix the problem. Both parties agree it's happening, the real differences come in on the proposed solutions.

DISCLAIMER: I am not trying to sway you away from the party with the first part of my comment, I am merely explaining how I vote in my personal life, and recommending that the OP do the same.

Warren Buffett doesn't spend all of his money for a couple of years.  He's got some cash laying around under his bed.  Person A comes up to him and says he's got a great idea that would ultimately reduce the cost of widgets (which everyone buys), but he doesn't have any cash.  Warren loans it to him and it works.  Price of widgets drops.  Now all the people who buy widgets have money left over that they used to use to buy widgets.  They want to buy something else.  Well, a lot of them decide they want to buy superballs.  In order to meet the increased demand, the company making superballs has to hire more people (maybe even buy some more machines).  Warren helps to fund that, too.  Now there are more jobs.  Process continues indefinitely.

Second, I don't believe that it should be the government's place to have such a large say in the allocation of its people's resources in order to benefit its other citizens livelihood. Now having said that, it is currently their duty to do public services: roads, post, police, military, and other public goods. No problems there. Also, I honestly have no problem with certain forms of welfare, in fact at one point I was on state healthcare. What a lot of people have a problem with, including me, are the few that abuse these systems. There should be no problem with helping those who truly need it, it should however be temporary.
You said ""Government works best when its being watched"", would you agree that instead of watching perhaps limiting would be better? 

When taxes are raised you take away money that could have potentially gone into the economy, stimulating it. My only negative on raising taxes.

Overall, it's just hard for a lot of people to accept the idea that the gov't is holding the hands of its citizens. I just want people to be independent, whenever possible.

cnyipnr,"&gt; What a lot of people have a problem with, including me, are the few that abuse these systems.

It's a somewhat appropriate concern, but it's not enough of a problem to warrant abolishing the whole system.  Yes, the entire structure of the Welfare system needs some fundamental changes. i.e. Working more efficiently to get people out of poverty rather than keeping them in it, as it does now.  I agree that we need harsher penalties and stricter enforcement when it comes to abusing the system.  

The problem people have is they get hung-up on the few that abuse the system.  Stop worrying about them and focus more on how we can better help the ones who need it, to stop needing it.  

Raising taxes does not always just rob from money that could be invested into the economy.  If we raise taxes and offer everyone free healthcare or free college, that's an expense that the people no longer have and can then funnel the money they would've spent on that into the economy.  

The myth that welfare or ""handouts"" some how disincentive people from striving for more is absurd.  I make enough money now to pay my bills, eat, and then some.  I still strive for more.  Greed, or the feeling of always wanting more is a natural instinct of humans.  It's why we have such a problem with money in politics etc.  Just because the government is helping someone out doesn't mean they are just going to be content with that.  They are going to want more, and eventually if people stop being lazy, they will work to achieve more.   ",democrats,1

Saying that the CO2 and changing solar levels are the cause are both reasonable, yet there isn't enough proof to determine which is the actual cause. That's one of the big problems the party has with climate change, IMO. The higher ups in the party don't entirely understand how science works, which makes this such a heated debate. There isn't enough science to back up either side of the coin at the moment. The majority of the scientific data is concerning the rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere, which the scientific community has generally accepted as having been caused by increase in population density. Its nothing we can ""fix"". We really just have to wait it out, while continuing to develop sustainable means for clean energy, like nuclear and solar. In my opinion, this whole debate about climate change, and what is causing it is beside the point. What does it matter what is causing it? We have the scientific data to prove that it's happening, and we need to do something about it, and in my opinion, and the opinion of many on both sides of the political spectrum, that something is to assist the private and public sector in their efforts to develop clean, sustainable energy sources.

2) The bitching about education is to move to charter schools, but guess what, with charters the tax payer will pay a 20% profit margin to a corporation, while they demand to be allowed to hire uncertified/unqualified teachers for your kids.  Don't believe me, not covered on Fox News, but Read your Republican legislation on Charter schools.

3) Internet.  Before Comcast/Verizon when there was a technology advance the Whole population was able to upgrade and benefit for a modest increase in cost.  Save from $25 to $35 dollars for higher speeds.

Now, Verizon has a 6 tier pricing structure, and those tiers haven't advanced for 4 years.  Essentially we have a FROZEN tech solution of 2010.  Gigabit internet is available but, now for $500 a month.  So, you're stuck in a tier, if you want faster internet Pay Thru the Nose.

Tiered Service is Substandard for Most of the population.

4) Without Government oversight the Boom-Bust cycle is Hard-Coded into Capitalism.  Like the California gold rush.  Looks at the fracking boom, it's been going on for the last three years, while there's been a glut on the market of supply, did these companies cut back production to match the lower demand.  No, they blindly rushed to exploit the resource, flooding the market, and then triggering a response from Saudi Arabia.

cnyydab,"This is from http://fpc.state.gov/6172.htm

&gt; This report identifies and illustrates 12 basic ways to make U.S. foreign policy. The President or the executive branch can make foreign policy through:

&gt; 1. responses to foreign events
&gt; 2. proposals for legislation
&gt; 3. negotiation of international agreements
&gt; 4. policy statements
&gt; 5. policy implementation
&gt; 6. independent action.

&gt; In nearly all of these circumstances, Congress can either support the President's approach or seek to change it. In the case of independent Presidential action, it may be very difficult to change policy in the short term; in the case of a legislative proposal by the executive branch or treaties and international agreements submitted to the Senate or Congress for approval, Congress has a decisive voice. In most cases Congress supports the President, but it often makes significant modifications in his initiatives in the process of approving them.

&gt; Congress can make foreign policy through:

&gt; 1. resolutions and policy statements
&gt; 2. legislative directives
&gt; 3. legislative pressure
&gt; 4. legislative restrictions/funding denials
&gt; 5. informal advice
&gt; 6. congressional oversight.

Clearly, since Congress is considering legislative action against Iran, the advice of a
foreign leader is acceptable.  Foreign leaders have frequently addressed the Congress in
the past as well.

Rape baby? Genetic disorder? Here you go you financially unstable, just as poor as I am, can't support yourself, let alone a child, whiny, cookie cutter Republican. 

There are plenty of children that are born who end up suffering most of their life. With republicans in charge these families get their financial assistance, school budget, and food stamps cut. 

Let's force people to have babies just so they can suffer and grow up to be poverty stricken, tiny stupid shits too hungry to think for themselves. Individuals that can't see through the distractions, like abortion, brought into congress just so overpaid politicians don't have to negotiate economic policies with us watching.

Well, I voted. But the rest of democrats in America are about as active as…well, as active as redditors are in *this* subreddit.

I would say it's a good thing because democrats are infamous for being lazy and spoiled when things are good. We're no longer struggling with the economy so democrats are too ignorant to be vigilant and to keep fighting for what's left of the middle class and the poor.

They're also ignorant to the idea that the republicans can and will destroy social security and medicaid/medicare if they can.

But dems? NAH, not worried. They're ""smart"" enough to wait until that shit gets destroyed and dismantled and *then* they'll get worked up and whine and cry and pretend to raise hell.

Honestly, I don't associate a whole lot wit the democratic party anymore because I'm an actual liberal and democrats seem to be shifting actively and happily toward the right (and have been for the past decade or so).

But I will say this about democrats: They are the most impotent, ineffectual group of people during modern times. As laughable as the republican party is, they at least have the balls and spine and spirit to get out there and fight and vote.

Oh, you have a special lock on ""truth""?  It is a national security issue because you say so?  

A fairly smart fellow once said ""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.""

So lets do a little thought experiment here:

Lets stipulate for our thought experiment that while the climate does in fact change, AGW is not the threat it is claimed to be, and CO2 is not the primary driver of warming.  

Let us further stipulate that most scientists make their living off grants from organizations who have an interest in a specific outcome from the research they are paid to do, that national governments are the primary financiers of climate research, and that people who go against the interests of those financing the research are drummed out of the field, fired, and blacklisted.

Next, let us stipulate that there are elements in the US who hold a substantial amount of political power, who believe that the US is responsible for much of the evil and inequality in the world today, and who believe that reduced US power and influence - particularly if combined with wealth transfer from the US to developing countries (in much the same way as the US government facilitates wealth transfer from the rich to the poor via the tax and social welfare systems), would be a good thing, and that the primary way of making this happen is for the US to cripple itself economically.

Lastly, let us stipulate that most other national governments either believe that reduced US power and influence is a good thing, expect to be on the receiving end of the wealth transfer, or both.

With those stipulations, does the current insistence on AGW make sense, from the standpoint of those doing so?

Now all the people who buy widgets have money left over that they used to use to buy widgets.""  If the middle class doesn't have enough money to buy the widgets, it won't matter how much investing power Warren Buffet has.  Right now, we have a 1% with 50% of the wealth.

I think the statist nature of the left, and the preponderance to lean on government, allows the Democrats to be much more unified in what they stand for.

Because of this, the Republican platform can be far more flexible than the Democrats', if they're willing to let it evolve.

It should be left up to employers to decide what perks they would like to offer employees, and employees will decide where they want to work based on the compensation packages available to them. That is all that is necessary and will work just fine. We don't need more interference from governmental mandates.

As Nebraska Senator Fischer said, the money to support that benefit will have to come from somewhere; some businesses don't believe it is a worthwhile investment to make, that the return on it is lower than the return on investing in other areas. That is their choice to make. If employees don't like that paid parental leave above and beyond the 12 weeks required by the Family and Medical Leave Act is not offered by a particular employer, they are free to accept employment elsewhere. It really is that simple.

The fact that Sen. Fischer is co-sponsoring a bill supporting tax credits given to private sector businesses who provide additional paid parental leave is completely awful. This is clearly territory the federal government need not trespass into. It is not a human rights violation, and if it is the wrong business decision to not offer additional paid leave then the market will clear these businesses out of the landscape. End of story.

Whether paid family leave is ""good for business"" or not is up for debate, and it most certainly is not as black and white as ""paid family leave good, not paid family leave bad"". It varies from industry to industry, employer to employer. Blanket fixes will not work and are a waste of time and money.

There are only so many hours in the day and you cannot be everywhere at once, doing everything at once.

True, if anyone doesn't have money to spend, then they can't be a consumer and they can't drive an economy.  This is true for a significant portion of the working poor.

True, assuming everything else is fixed (i.e. the size of the economy, or the pie), the economy could function better if 1% of the people held 20% of the wealth instead of 50%.

But, where we disagree is that there is a reasonable proposal for making that come about.  Excessive taxation might for example redistribute wealth but it will actually cause the amount of wealth that can be redistributed (the pie) to shrink.  Most generally and among other things because (i) you will reduce the incentive for richer people to work (so hard and in the US) so that they end up generating less money for taxes (we saw this most recently with France's 75% tax rate); and (ii) money that otherwise would have been being used in as optimal of a way possible given the then-existing economic structure would be used in an even less sub-optimal way (primarily, filtered through the government which, while I'm not exactly a believer that government necessarily always causes waste, is clearly not as good at getting the most value out of a dollar as pretty much anyone else would be).

Rather than having a government law that requires paid leave, offer other benefits, so that businesses can *decide for themselves* what to do, they don't have to accept it, but doing so will make financial sense in terms of tax benefits.

The whole paternity only being 6 weeks of leave rather than 12 weeks for maternity is disgusting. Whether it's paid or unpaid, if the father decides to stay home so that the mother can go to work, they automatically get half the time off. That's disappointing.

They always seem to forget when doing so, that they will not *always* have the majority.

Lets imagine that the shoe were on the other foot, and we had someone in Paul's position saying:

For serving as the flunky of a crook, he received a generous tip of $75,000 from Recarey, a mob associate.  He performed a similar service, with more success, on behalf of the Cuban militant Orlando Bosch, for whom he sought a presidential pardon from his father. The boastful murderer of dozens of innocent people — and a prosecution target of the U.S. Justice Department — Bosch deserved a pardon about as much as the worst jihadi in Gitmo. But his sponsors were the same Cuban-Americans in Miami who had fostered Jeb’s real estate business there, so he ignored the Republican attorney general’s denunciation of Bosch as an “unreformed terrorist.”

Elect Jeb, and the War on Terror is over!

Granted, if America goes full Honey Boo Boo and elects Jeb, it would be awkward for the CIA to switch back from torturing terror suspects to hiring them again. Perhaps they can rectally feed them chocolate and brandy first.

Hope This Helps!

Many states in the country had this before Obamacare and it just didn't work.  They were costing, depending on the estimate you go with, between $15-$20 billion per year.  That leaves a $50-$100 billion shortfall.  

Statements like ""this plan is brilliant"" really get under my skin.  All these people that like these ideas- where were they back in 2005-2008 when people were begging for better support for these programs?

As someone who has had to use one of these guarantee issue plans, let me tell you they stink.  High deductible, very little of what I had to pay out of pocket actually counted toward my deductible.  I was spending about $1000 a month on healthcare, not including my monthly premium.  We are not an unhealthy family.

Obamacare is riddled with flaws and I, as a doctor, am frustrated with it.  However, seeing how politics in this country is, I have absolutely no confidence in the ability for the people in Washington to put in something better.  

The bar is set.  Obamacare does not set a high bar at all but if the Republicans shove something down our throats that ends up being worse than Obamacare, I will never cast another vote for them in my lifetime.

As far as replacing it- I really don't have that answer.  I've come to the realization that we, as a country, have been coming to this conversation with the goal of lowering cost when the real goal should be improving patient outcomes.  I used to believe that it was possible to do both but I no longer feel that way.  If you're goal is to improve patient care and patient outcomes, it is going to raise costs.  Anything that cuts costs is going to hurt patient outcomes.  

I do have some hope for the future, though as I feel these are problems for the short term.  I think in 20-30 years we will be able to use computers and automation in medicine to diagnose and treat disease.  A program already exists that is a damn accurate diagnostician by simply asking questions.  Make it an app on your smart phone and pair it with a device that can do a ""blood test"" by simply pricking your finger or breathing into it and it can then send your prescription electronically to the pharmacy for you to pick up.

I don't see any one system working for the entire population.  For example, I feel a free market system might work for those in the 0-45 year old group.  For those with chronic disease and the elderly, a socialized system probably fits better.

At the start of my career, I was fully entrenched as a free market in medicine supporter but as time goes on, I become less and less confident that it can work.  The alternative medicine market has broken me of my faith in the free market.  In alternative medicine, the price of treatments are increasing and NONE of it works.

Both parties are engaged in meaningless showmanship and the less fortunate- those who are ill- are the ones who are being punished. 

I hated Obamacare when it came out.  HATED it.  It has grown on me slightly.  There are a couple of things they did right (it still doesn't overshadow what they got wrong).  I would prefer the focus on fixing what we've got. 

One aspect that I think they got right- and my opinion on this has made people question my standing as a conservative- are the required coverages in medical insurance.  I do understand the conservative/libertarian view that people should be allowed to purchase whatever insurance they want but I can tell you from personal experience that people don't understand how insurance works and they don't realize they made a poor choice of which plan to get until they're in a whole. 

I'm an eye doctor and WAY too often patients would need additional testing to help diagnose and treat eye disease.  10 minutes later I hear them saying at the front desk ""what do you mean my insurance doesn't cover the test?""  They end up not scheduling the test, putting them self in position to go blind.

When I was in school, I imagined it was mostly the elderly and poor that would do this but just as often it was well educated people who appeared to be quite well off.  You're going to risk going blind because your insurance doesn't cover the $70 test?  Really Mr. Lawyer?

I'm skeptical that individuals will receive better rates than businesses which have the bargaining power of walking off with hundreds of plans simultaneously. I agree that making workers dependent on businesses for healthcare hurts the labor movement (major loss of bargaining power when your boss controls your family's healthcare) and that it adds a ton of overhead to business management, but I don't see how ditching that plan without some other coalition or grouping of insurees is going to have a positive impact on prices, and what actor but the government is left if not businesses?

&gt;2. They want to reform medical malpractice laws (likely through carrot incentives to the states);

What does this mean? If my daughter dies I lose the ability to walk because of negligence, exactly how much compensation will I be limited to? How is that going to scale with inflation? The most optimistic figures I've seen for tort reform anticipate a whopping 2% cost reduction. Some anticipate only .5%, and at what cost? The state is going to just shift the cost onto the disability payment books.

&gt;3. They want to allow for insurance purchases across state lines;

What federal law is preventing this? I'm under the impression that it's state laws preventing it because each state has its own health care industry. This is a call for the feds to strip regulatory power from the states, how is that a conservative stance? There would be major winners and losers amongst the states once health care providers started consolidating their offices.

&gt;4. They want to support state-level pre-existing condition pools;

How is this fundamentally different than the state expansion of medicare/medicaid? Why would Republican governors and state legislatures hop on board with this after declining the last round of federal subsidies?

&gt;5. They want to fully block grant Medicaid;

The same governors who blocked Medicaid expansion are going to do what exactly with greater discretion over the programs they dislike? I'm very skeptical about this.

How is this an alternative to Obamacare? Just do it now. Do it 6 years ago already. If there's a part of the approval process that provides no value, then who would be against it?

&gt;8. They want to maximize the health savings account model, one of the few avenues proven to lower health care spending, making these high deductible + HSA plans more attractive where Obamacare hamstrung them.

Seems reasonable. The deductibles on Obamacare plans are so high already that I'm not sure what appeal they have over HSAs.

Meanwhile, Republican candidates tend to persist in taking that astroturf line, in their craven pandering to corporate ""interests"", which, as this poll implies, will not likely go well for them, electorally, going forward.

As much as Republicans (and Blue Dog ilk) may start to scramble rhetorically, to try to co-opt this and other issues, anyone with a brain can tell they're lying through their teeth...and whose ""interests"" they serve.

Meanwhile, the more progressive Democrats, now the largest caucus in the Party (since it was mostly Blue Dog ilk who lost their seats in '10), have rammed through administrators, funding and staff to fire up previously crippled EPA, et al, ratcheting up regulation and enforcement in many regards, despite the best efforts of Republicans to prevent it, or failing that, to sabotage it.

co6w2y4,"1.Stop tax breaks to business for buying healthcare

Couple of thoughts, your critique seems to assume:  (a) that most of the US population works for a company like Walmart, but something like at least 50% of US workers work for a business that has 500 or fewer employers - that lowers the magnitude of whatever bargaining power you see; (b) the ability to move out of an insurance plan isn't a bargaining power against insurers; and (c) that businesses use the bargaining power they do have uniformly to help their employees, rather than themselves.  And FWIW, there are other coalitions set up that allow people to buy insurance in groups, they largely suck because most people get their insurance through work.

2.Med Mal tort reform.

The savings you're talking about is much larger than the savings we anticipated getting from solving the problem of people without insurance showing up at hospitals, yet that was a big rationale for the ACA.  I very strongly disagree with your characterization of med mal cases - huge numbers of frivolous lawsuits are filed constantly, for example in NY.  Frankly, yes I think that if your daughter dies it's a horrible tragedy, but you shouldn't get $500 MM because of it; you're not actually going to feel better and it just drives up costs everywhere.

3.Insurance purchases across state lines

Frankly, I'm not a ""conservative"" in the sense of the word I think you're using; I'm a Republican.  A national insurance market would be better than State insurance markets.  I guess the most basic answer to your question though is that working toward a national insurance system wouldn't take regulatory power away from the States would still be able to instruct insurers in their state to conform to their regulation.  People just wouldn't be limited to in-state insurance.

4.State-level pre-existing condition pools.

[I don't understand this is, and have admitted as much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/2u506d/republicans_house_to_begin_work_on_health_care/co5ag23?context=3).  It's probably because I'm really not a health care wonk.  But, just as a side reference, this is one of the problems with arguing only by inquiry.

5.Fully block grant medicaid.

Common misconception:  the governors who blocked medicaid expansion didn't do that because they hate poor people, they did it because the State couldn't afford it.

6.Shift Medicare to premium support

Make that two of us.

7.FDA + Drugs

I'm not sure who you're blaming for this not already having happened, but I agree it's the federal government's fault.

co6x9fb,"&gt; We're not talking about temporary variations because of a strong wind. We're talking about 100+ years of aggregate data for some of the stations.

The UHI takes effect when, well, an urban area heats up due to direct heating of urban spaces. If you have a strong wind, this prevents the UHI effect from building up, which means that you can estimate it by looking at the differences in temps when the wing is and is not blowing.

In any event, we also have satellite data now, meaning we have an independent source of temps apart from the surface stations, which also correlate what the surface stations are saying.",Republican,1

Yes, what makes it a genetic fallacy is that you are rejecting the premise by attacking the sources to avoid dealing with the information.  Which you just did.  Again.  Show something that proves this article is ""Nazi propaganda"".

&gt; So if I dropped some media matters articles or mother goose on you you'd believe them cause they are written down huh?

Nope - I would go after the substance, not the source, where they make verifiable claims, and point out bias and blatant lies.  Of course that sort of thing gets tedious when the source lies constantly as politicsusa.com, vox.com, dailykos, and the like do.  That's one of the reasons I rarely interact on /r/politics.  People get paid to write that bullshit, and I don't have the time, in addition to my regular job, to debunk it all from three million users who will repost it 12 times a day.

...which is why it makes some sense to restrict those domains from subreddits designed for people who are ideologically opposed to what those sites spew.  We really don't need liberals posting that crap here so we have to debunk it over and over.  There are too few legitimate users here, we wouldn't be able to do anything else but spend all our time debunking it or let it stand, and this isn't our job where we could do this for a living and spend all our time here.  Reddit is overwhelmingly liberal, we get that.

That said, you choose to interact here, so you get to deal with the sources that *we* think are legitimate.

&gt; And I'm a moderate registered republican who most aligns with the politics of presidents like George h.w. bush or Eisenhower.

Yeah, and I'm your fairy godmother.  Making the claim means nothing.

&gt; There's part of me that wonders if Obama's folks think Bibi is chickenshit because he is making them address Iran's nuclear situation instead of just bombing it themselves and taking all the blame.

If you go back to when the ""chickenshit"" comment was made, that was pretty much exactly what happened.  Obama was trying to have his cake and eat it too.  The plan appeared to be that the US would do everything possible to make an agreement with the Iranians that would (on paper) restrict their nuclear ambitions, while in actuality doing everything but selling them nukes.  Then Israel was supposed to go in and bomb the Iranian facilities, and Obama would blame them for being warmongering and evil.  ...only the Israelis refused to be the scapegoat.  That's when the ""chickenshit"" comment came out.  Obama would have looked like a peacemaker, the Iranians wouldn't get their nukes, and Obama would be able to blame the Israelis for being evil even while they were doing what he wanted done.",Republican,1

co73ib6,"&gt; The weather stations referenced in the article were specifically rural stations, where UHI wouldn't be a factor.

Are you familiar with the surface station survey? The core issue was that a number of stations marked ""rural"" had had development over the decades, and the theory was that this was what was leading to the rise of global surface temperatures.

There's plenty of examples of cases where, for example, a rural station was now surrounded by an asphalt parking lot, or even worse, situation underneath an heat exhaust vent. 

This is why a number of stations were calibrated down over the years.

&gt;Further, if UHI were a factor, the raw data would be higher and it would have to be adjusted lower not the other way around.

You're absolutely right, and I don't know why in particular the Patagonian stations were calibrated up instead of down. Most are calibrated down, in fact. The author might have been cherry picking stations that calibrated up instead. Given his lack of knowledge about why these calibrations take place, I'm not especially confident in him having enough knowledge to even be writing articles like these.

The end result of all the surface station controversy was that it didn't, in fact, make any difference to the global temperature averages. And, as I mentioned before, we have satellite data to provide confirmation of surface station data.

A lot of people have attacked Watts for his surface station survey, but I do think it was very valuable to have people actually go out an look at surface stations rather than relying on statistical methods to calibrate the data.
